“You should also submit a brief description of who did what work. (This should be no more than a page, probably substantially shorter.) Did you sit at a computer together working? Split things up? Test each others' code? You should describe briefly what parts each person worked on, what was worked on together (and what "worked on together" meant for you) and how you coordinated your efforts.”

“Make sure your description includes all the information that is required, including a breakdown of the points you earned and how you earned them. If you worked with a partner, include a description of how the work was divided.”
